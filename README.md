# How about a game of exquisite corpse?

## Background

Excerpted from the MoMALearning article [linked here](https://www.moma.org/collection/terms/exquisite-corpse): 

>Surrealist artists played a collaborative, chance-based parlor game, typically involving four players, called Cadavre Exquis (Exquisite Corpse). Each participant would draw an image (or, on some occasions, paste an image down) on a sheet of paper, fold the paper to conceal their contribution, and pass it on to the next player for his contribution. [...] For the Surrealists, Exquisite Corpse was a perfect parlor game, involving elements of unpredictability, chance, unseen elements, and group collaboration—all in service of disrupting the waking mind’s penchant for order.

## How to play exquisite corpse on GitHub

1. **Switch to the game-1.3 branch**: In the top-left corner of the zmuhls/exquisite-corpse repository, find the branch dropdown (it should say main by default). Click it and select the game-1.3 branch.
2. **Edit the game.md file**: While in the game-1.3 branch, scroll down and find the game.md file (below the README.md file). Click on it, then select the pencil icon in the top-right corner to start editing.
3. **Add your line of poetry**: Add a line of poetry to the number that’s been assigned to you! Be creative, but make sure to follow the rules of the exquisite corpse game—no peeking at what the others have added.
4. **Commit your changes**: After adding your line, scroll down to the commit section. Give your commit a name (e.g., “Added line 3”) and a brief summary of what you did (e.g., “Added my assigned line of poetry”). Click Propose Changes to create a new fork of the game-1.3 branch under your GitHub account, allowing you to submit your changes for review.
5. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**: After forking the repository, you’ll be redirected to the pull request page. Make sure that your fork (i.e., your-username/exquisite-corpse) is set as the head repository and zmuhls/exquisite-corpse is set as the base repository. Verify that you’re proposing to merge your changes into the game-1.3 branch, not main. Then, click Create pull request.
6. **Create and title your pull request**: Give your pull request a title (e.g., “Alex’s Line for the Exquisite Corpse”). You can also leave a comment if you’d like to explain anything about your contribution, though it’s not required. Click Create pull request to submit your changes for review.
7. **Wait for review**: I will review your pull request, and once I approve it, your line will be merged into the game-1.3 branch. If I need any adjustments, I’ll let you know in the pull request comments.
8. **Final merge to the main branch**: After everyone’s lines are merged into game-1.3, I’ll merge the completed poem with the main branch to finalize the project.

And that’s it! We’ll have a collaboratively written exquisite corpse poem.

Neat, right?
